    "# Spack \n",
    "\n",
    "**Spack** is a flexible package manager tailored for high-performance computing (HPC). It helps build, install, and manage multiple versions of software and their dependencies, which is especially useful when working with GPU computing, where specific compiler versions and libraries might be needed. For example, it could be the case that you want to use the `Intel oneAPI` for the best performance on Intel-optimised code or to build your code with `GCC` to have a fully open-source toolchain, alongside a number of other reasons, such as particular compilers have preferential performance on a given architecture or perform more stably. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started with Spack\n",
    "\n",
    "Even when running GPU code with an interpreted language like Python, you may need compiled libraries under the hood (e.g., CUDA, numerical libraries). This is where a tool like Spack is highly recommended to manage those dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Instal Spack:**: Clone the Spack repository from GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Source Spack Setup**: Add Spack to your shell by sourcing the setup script: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "source spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to `source` this file for each terminal session you open. If you want this to be done automatically for you, then you can: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Bash (e.g. Ubuntu, WSL)**\n",
    "Open your `~/.bashrc` file\n",
    "At the bottom of the file, add:\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "# — Load Spack on shell startup\n",
    "source /path/to/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Zsh (e.g. macOS): \n",
    "Open your `~/.zshrc` file\n",
    "At the bottom of the file, add the following:\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "# — Load Spack on shell startup\n",
    "source /path/to/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! note \n",
    "\tReplace /path/to/spack with the actual directory where you cloned or installed Spack. If you ever move or upgrade Spack, just update that one line in your startup file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now every time you open the terminal, you should have Spack loaded and ready to use that you can verify with: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "••Create and Activate an Environment**: It's good practice to use a Spack *environment* to isolate your project's packages. For example, for this course, you might want to do the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack env create gpu_training\n",
    "spack env activate -p gpu_training\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-p` flag creates a *view* that makes packages from this environment visible in your shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! note\n",
    "\tSpack environments allow you to experiment without affecting your system or other projects. If something goes wrong, you can deactivate or delete the environment and start fresh, which is very useful in HPC contexts where different projects might require different dependencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Use Spack?\n",
    "Spack's core purpose is to simplify handling **complex dependencies** and **multiple versions/variants** of software in HPC: \n",
    "- **Complex Dependencies**: Spack can manage intricate dependency trees (including multiple versions of the same library or specific compiler requirements). For example, one compiler might produce faster GPU code than another. Spack makes it easy to create a separate environment for each compiler to compare. \n",
    "- **Multiple Versions and Variants**: If you need different builds of the same software, then Spack can install different compilers such as GCC 9 and GCC 11 side by side or build a library with different features (variants) like `+mpi` or different precision modes. This fine-grained control is crucial in HPC, where you might tune the build for performance. \n",
    "\n",
    "These features are the main draw of Spack. You can even create your own package receipt, apply patches, and maintain custom package repositories. Those topics are beyond this course, but it is good to understand that these options are available if you need to implement them down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Guided Tour of Spack Commands \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through common Spack commands and concepts using our `gpu_training` environment as context: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Listing Available Packages \n",
    "To see what software is available through Spack (it has thousands of packages, including Python libraries, scientific libraries, compilers, etc.), use: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will display a list of package names. For instance, many Python libraries are prefixed with `py-` (e.g. `pu-numpy` for NumPy). You can search within this list or use `spack search <name>` for a keyword search. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Packages to an Environment\n",
    "To add a package to your current Spack environment (without installing yet), use `spack add`. For example, to add NumPy: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack add py-numpy \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you're just declaring you want NumPy in the environment. You haven't installed anything yet. You can add multiple packages (e.g. ` Spack add py-scipy py-cupy` to add SciPy and CuPy as well). Think of `spack add` as saying *\"I plan to use these packages.\". \n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing the Environment Spec \n",
    "After adding packages, you can see what Spack plans to install by checking the **specification**:\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack spec \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command outputs a detailed tree of all packages and dependencies that would be installed for the current environment configuration. **Importantly, this shows the plan *before* installation. The output includes each package's name, version, compiler, variants, etc., and whether it's already installed or not. \n",
    "Some symbols you might see in the `spack spec` output: \n",
    "- `-` (dash): The package is not yet installed; Spack will build it. \n",
    "- `+` (plus): The package has already been installed and will be reused. \n",
    "- `[e]` (external): Package is found externally on the system (e.g. system MPI or CUDA library); Spack will use that rather than build a new one. \n",
    "Each line also shows a **spec string** for the package. A spec string has the format: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "<package-name>@<version>%<compiler>@<compiler-version> build_system=<build-system> arch=<platform>-<os>-<target> [variants]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "py-numpy@1.21.2%gcc@11.4.1 build_system=python_pip arch=linux-ubuntu20.04-zen2\n",
    "```\n",
    "Including the components of: \n",
    "- **Package name**: `py-numpy` \n",
    "- **Version**: `1.21.2`\n",
    "- **Compiler**: `gcc`\n",
    "- **Compiler version**: `11.4.1` \n",
    "- **Build system**: `python_pip`, meaning it uses pip/wheel to install. \n",
    "- **Architecture**: platform `linux`, OS `ubuntu20.04`, target CPU architecture `zen2` (AMD Zen2 in this case). \n",
    "\n",
    "Variants and additional options (if any) would appear as `+feature` or `~feature` flags and other `key=value` settings in the spec. For instance, a spec might include `+cuda` if a package can be built with CUDA support. \n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the spec output helps you verify that Spack picked the right versions and options. If not, you can adjust by specifying versions or variants in the `spack add` command (for example, `spack add py-numpy@1.19.5` to request a specific older NumPy). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Dependencies**: In the spec output, you'll see dependencies indented under main packages, often prefixed by `^`. For example, NumPy may depend on BLAS libraries or a specific Python version. Spack will list those. A snippet might look like: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    " -   py-numpy@1.21.2%gcc@11.4.1 ...\n",
    "[+]      ^python@3.10.4%gcc@11.4.1 ...\n",
    " -         ^openblas@0.3.18%gcc@11.4.1 +fortran +pic ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, NumPy depends on Python (already installed, as indicated by `+`) and OpenBLAS (not installed yet, indicated by `-` and will be built with Fortran support `+fortran`). This hierarchical view is a key feature of Spack. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modifying the Spec \n",
    "Until you actually install it, you can modify your environment specs. For instance, if you realise you need a different version of a package, you can add it with a version qualifier and remove the old one: \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we added `py-numpy` (which defaulted to the latest 2.x), but we need NumPy 1.x for compatibility; we can do the: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack add py-numpy@1.21.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Spack will now plan to use NumPy 1.21.0. Running `spack spec` again will show the updated plan. You could remove the undesired spec with `spack remove py-numpy@2.1.2` if it was explicitly listed, but if you add a new version, Spack will typically reconcile the spec to use the one you last added.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installing Packages \n",
    "Once you are satisfied with the planned specs, install everything in the environment with the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack install \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will download, build, and install all packages in the spec (including dependencies). This may take some time for big packages or if a compiler needs to be built. \n",
    "\n",
    "After installation, the packages are now present in Spack'` directory (`spack/opt/...`) and linked to your environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Installed Packages \n",
    "\n",
    "If you activate the environment with `-p`, Spack auto-generates a view of the installed packages. This means you can immediately use the software. For example, after installing `py-numpy`, you should be able to run `python` and `import numpy` because the environment's Python points to one with NumPy installed, or your `PYTHONPATH` is set appropriately. \n",
    "\n",
    "In cases where you did not use `-p` or if you want fine control, you can manually load packages into your shell session. For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack load py-numpy \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This modifies environment variables (like `PATH` and `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`) so that the loaded package is accessible. If you installed multiple versions, you can specify which one to load (space will tell you if multiple matches are found). You can also unload packages with `spack unload`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see all packages installed in your current environment (or globally), use: \n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack find\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This lists installed packages and versions, which can be hopeful to verify installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Deactivate the Environment \n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done or want to switch context, deactivate the Spack environment with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "spack env deactivate \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will restore your shell to not knowing about the environment's packages. You can later reactivate it with `spack env activate -p gpu_training` when needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Spack Quick Reference \n",
    "- `spack list <query>` – List available packages matching <query> (or all packages if no query).\n",
    "- `spack info <package>` – Show details about a package (versions, variants, dependencies).\n",
    "- `spack add <package>` – Add a package to the current environment (does not install).\n",
    "- `spack remove <package>` – Remove a package from the current environment spec.\n",
    "- `spack spec` – Show the full dependency graph (spec) for the environment and which parts are installed.\n",
    "- `spack install` – Install the environment’s spec (download and build everything needed).\n",
    "- `spack find` – List installed packages (in current env or globally).\n",
    "- `spack load <package>` – Load an installed package to use in the shell (especially if not using -p activation).\n",
    "- `spack unload <package>` – Unload a package from the environment variables.\n",
    "- `spack env activate <env>` – Activate a named environment (use -p for package view).\n",
    "- `spack env deactivate` – Deactivate the current environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! note \n",
    "\tIf Spack ever behaves oddly (perhaps due to old cache or config issues), a last resort is to remove `~/.spack` (Spack's config cache in your home) to reset Spack's state. This is rarely neded, but can resolve mysterious issues by giving Spack a \"clean slate\". \n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- Spack manages multiple versions and configurations of software seamlessly, which is crucial in GPU/HPC setups.\n",
    "- Use **environments** to isolate projects. Add desired packages, then install them.\n",
    "- `spack spec` helps you review what will be installed **before** building anything – use it to verify versions and dependencies.\n",
    "- Installing via `spack install` in an environment builds all needed software. After that, you can use the software (especially with `-p` activated environments or by loading packages).\n",
    "- Spack’s power is in handling complex dependency scenarios that other package managers struggle with, making it ideal for research and GPU computing setups.\n"
