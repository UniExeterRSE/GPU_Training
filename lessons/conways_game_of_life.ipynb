    "# Project: Conway's Game of Life - CPU vs GPU Implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we are going to implement **Conway's Game of Life**, a classic cellular automaton in two ways: first using NumPy (to run on the CPU) and then using CuPy (to run on the GPU). We'll also visualise the evolution of the Game of Life grid to see the computation in action. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Conway's Game of Life?\n",
    "It's a zero-player game devised by John Conway, where you have a grid of cells that live or die based on a few simple rules:\n",
    "Each cell can be \"alive\" (1) or \"dead\" (0).\n",
    "At each time step (generation), the following rules apply to every cell simultaneously:\n",
    "Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation).\n",
    "Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives on to the next generation (survival).\n",
    "Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation).\n",
    "Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction).\n",
    "Neighbours are the 8 cells touching a given cell horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.\n",
    "From these simple rules emerges a lot of interesting behaviour – stable patterns, oscillators, spaceships (patterns that move), etc. It's a good example of a grid-based simulation that can benefit from parallel computation because the state of each cell for the next generation can be computed independently (based on the current generation).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visualisation of Game of Life\n",
    "To make this project more visually engaging, below is an **animated GIF** showing an example of a Game of Life simulation starting from a random initial configuration. White pixels represent live cells, and black pixels represent dead cells. You can see patterns forming, moving, and changing over time:\n",
    "An example evolution of Conway's Game of Life over a few generations (white = alive, black = dead).\n",
    "(The animation demonstrates how random initial clusters of cells can evolve into interesting patterns. Notice some cells blink on and off or form moving patterns.)\n",
    "Now, let's implement the simulation ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation using NumPy (CPU) \n",
    "We will use a 2D grid (NumPy array) to represent the Game of Life board. A straightforward way to update the grid is \n",
    "For each cell, count the number of living neighbours around it. \n",
    "Apply the game of life rules to determine if the cell will be alive or dead in the next generation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A naive implementation might use nested loops to check neighbours, but that would be slow in Python. Instead, we can use NumPy's array operations to do this more efficiently by operating on whole arrays at once. \n",

    "We use `np.roll` to shift the grid up, down, left, right and on diagonals to get the neighbour counts. For instance, `np.roll(grid, 1, axis=0)` shifts everything up by one (so element [i,j] moves to [i+1,j], meaning it was a neighbour below), and `np.roll(grid, 1, axis=1)` shifts everything left. By combining these, we get all eight neighbours.\n",

    "Then, we use `np.where` to apply the rules vectorized across the array:\n",

    "- We haven’t explicitly measured time here, but you could use Python’s time module or `%timeit` in a Jupyter notebook to compare the CPU and GPU versions. Just remember to synchronize GPU calls if timing (CuPy operations are asynchronous by default, so use `cp.cuda.Stream.null.synchronize()` before stopping the timer, or use CuPy’s built-in benchmarking utilities).\n",

There are some GPU-aware visualisation tools, such as DirectX, that could display GPU data directly, but that is outside of the scope of this course. "
