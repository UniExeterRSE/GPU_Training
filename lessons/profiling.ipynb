    "# Profiling and Optimisation of CPU and GPU Code\n",
    "Writing code is the first problem, but generally, the second is **optimising** code for performance, an equally important skill, especially in GPU computing. Before optimising, you need to know *where* the time is being spent, which is where **profiling** comes in. Profiling means measuring the performance characteristics of your program, typically which parts of the code consume the most time or resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Profiling Python Code with cPython (CPU) \n",
    "Python has a built-in profiler called **cPython**. It can help you find which functions are taking up the most time in your program. This is key before you go into GPU acceleration; sometimes, you might find bottlenecks in places you didn't expect or identify parts of the code that would benefit the most from being moved to the GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to use cProfile \n",
    "You can make use of cProfile via the command line: `python -m cProfile -o profile_results.pstats myscript.py`, which will run `myscript.py` under the profiler and output stats to a file.\n",

So in this example, `life_step_naive` spent about 4.147 s in its own Python loops, and an extra ~0.003 s in whatever minor sub-calls it did (array indexing, % operations, etc.), for a total of 4.150 s. The per-call columns are simply` tottime/ncalls` and `cumtime/ncalls`, and the single call to `simulate_life_naive` shows its cumulative 4.312 s includes all the 100 naive steps plus the list-append overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Bottlenecks \n",
    "\n",
    "To pinpoint where your code spends most of its time, look at the cumulative time (`cumtime`) column in the profiler report. This shows the total time in a function plus all of its sub-calls. A high total time (`tottime`) means that the function’s own Python code is heavy, whereas a large gap between `cumtime` and `tottime` reveals significant work in any functions it invokes (array indexing, modulo ops, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our naive Game of Life example:\n",
    "- `life_step_naive` is called 100 times, with `tottime ≈ 4.147 s` and `cumtime ≈ 4.150 s`.\n",
    "    - Almost all the work is in its own nested loops and per-cell logic.\n",
    "    - Only a few milliseconds are spent in its sub-calls (grid indexing, % arithmetic).\n",
    "- `simulate_life_naive` appears once with `cumtime ≈ 4.312 s`, which covers the single Python loop plus all 100 calls to `life_step_naive`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you’ve identified the culprit:\n",
    "- If you have high `tottime` in a Python function, you may want to consider consider vectorising inner loops (e.g. switch to NumPy’s np.roll + np.where) or using a compiled extension.\n",
    "- If you have heavy external calls under your `cumtime`, then you may want to explore hardware acceleration (e.g. GPU via `CuPy`) or more efficient algorithms.\n",

    "### Why is it so much faster than the naive version?\n",
    "- **Bulk C-level operations**\n",
    "    - The eight `np.roll` shifts and the single `np.where` are all implemented in optimised C loops. \n",
    "    - cProfile only attributes a few milliseconds to Python itself because the heavy lifting happens outside Python's interpreter. \n",
    "- **Minimal Python overhead**\n",
    "    - We pay one Python-level call per generation (100 calls total) versus *hundreds of thousands* of Python-loop iterations in the naive version. \n",
    "    - That drops the Python-layer `tottime` from ~4s (naive) to ~0.03s (NumPy)\n",
    "- **Cache and vector-friendly memory access**\n",
    "    - NumPy works on large contiguous buffers, so the CPU prefetches data and applies vector instructions.\n",
    "    - The naïve per-cell modulo arithmetic and scattered indexing defeat those hardware optimisations.\n",

    "Overall, by moving the neighbour counting and rule application into a few large NumPy calls, we cut down Python‐level time from over 4 seconds to under 0.1 seconds for 100 generations on a 200×200 grid."

    "Going into the individual calls being performed within the CUDA API is outside of the scope of this course. However, this table does give a better idea of what is happening with the GPU if you require going into that detail for your optimisations. For example, `cudaFree` is a runtime call that releases device memory allocation. This is called in CuPy, every time a `cp.ndarray` (or call `.get()`/`.astype()`), to free the memory that was being used. The key part that makes this expensive is that `cudaFree` is a synchronous operation, so the CPU will stall until the GPU has completed this step. The actionable step we could take to reduce this is to minimise these calls. Instead of freeing every array after each iteration, we could **pre-allocate** a buffer once and **reuse** it for every step, eliminating repeated synchronisation. \n",

    "- **Python loops severely degrade performance**: Over 72% of run time is in the naive implementations, so vectorisation (NumPy/CuPy) is critical. \n",
    "- **Implicit syncs dominate**: `cudaFree` stalls the pipe, and so avoiding per-iteration free(0 calls by reusing buffers is key. \n",
    "- **Kernel work is tiny**: Each kernel takes ~1-2µs; orchestration (kernel launches + memops) is the real bottleneck.\n",
    "- **Memcopy patterns matter**: 7200 small transfers add up, so we need to use larger batches of copies to reduce the overhead.\n",

    "## General Optimisation Strategies\n",
    "Bringing everything together, some strategies include:\n",
    "**On the CPU side (Python)**: \n",
    "- **Vectorise Operations**: We saw this with NumPy; doing things in batch is faster than Python loops. \n",
    "- **Use efficient libraries**: If a certain computation is slow in Python, see if there is a library (NumPy, SciPy, etc) that does it in C or another language. \n",
    "- **Optimise algorithms**: Sometimes, a better algorithm can speed things up more than any level of optimisation. For example, if you find a certain computation is N^2 in complexity and it's slow, see if you can make it N log N or similar.\n",
    "- **Consider multiprocessing or parallelisation**: Use multiple CPU cores (with `multiprocessing` or `joblib` or others) if appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On the GPU side**:\n",
    "- **Minimise data transfers**: Once data is on the GPU, try to do as much as possible there. Transferring large arrays back and forth every iteration will kill performance. Maybe accumulate results and transfer once at the end, or use pinned memory for faster transfers if you must.\n",
    "- **Kernel fusion / reducing launch overhead**: Each call (like our multiple `cp.roll` operations) launches separate kernels. If possible, combining operations into one kernel means the GPU can do it all in one pass. Some libraries or tools do this automatically (for example, CuPy might fuse elementwise operations under the hood, and deep learning frameworks definitely fuse a lot of ops). If not, one can write a custom CUDA kernel to do more work in one go.\n",
    "- **Asynchronous overlap**: GPUs operate asynchronously relative to the CPU. You can have the CPU queue up work and then do something else (like prepare next batch of data) while GPU is processing. Nsight can show if your CPU and GPU are overlapping or if one is waiting for the other. Ideally, you overlap communication (PCIe transfers) with computation if possible.\n",
    "- **Memory access patterns**: This is more advanced, but if diving into custom kernel, coalesced memory access (accessing consecutive memory addresses in threads that are next to each other) is important for performance. Uncoalesced or random access can slow down even if arithmetic is small.\n",
    "- **Use specialised libraries**: For certain tasks, libraries like cuDNN (deep neural nets), cuBLAS (linear algebra), etc., are heavily optimised. Always prefer a library call (e.g., `cp.fft` or `cp.linalg`) over writing your own, if it fits the need, because those are likely tuned for performance.\n"
